# @ember-data/legacy-compat

:::warning ⚠️ Legacy Compatibility Package
This package provides **compatibility shims** to bridge legacy EmberData patterns (Models, Adapters, Serializers) with modern WarpDrive infrastructure (RequestManager, Handlers, Cache).

**For new projects:** Do not use this package. Start with {@link @warp-drive/core! | @warp-drive/core} and modern patterns (schemas, Handlers, request builders).
:::

This package exists to help apps migrate incrementally from legacy EmberData patterns to modern WarpDrive.

**Why it exists:** When migrating from legacy EmberData to modern WarpDrive, you may need to:
- Use `@ember-data/model` classes with the new `RequestManager`
- Keep Adapters/Serializers working while adopting new patterns incrementally
- Maintain backward compatibility during a gradual migration

**What it provides:**
- `LegacyNetworkHandler` - Allows Adapters and Serializers to work with RequestManager
- Compatibility layers that translate between legacy APIs and modern WarpDrive internals
- Hooks to integrate Model classes with the modern Store

**When to use this:** Only use this package during a migration from legacy EmberData to modern WarpDrive. It allows you to adopt modern patterns incrementally while keeping your existing code working.

For guidance on incremental migration strategies, see the [Migration Guide](/guides/migrating) and [Two Store Migration Strategy](/guides/migrating/two-store-migration).
