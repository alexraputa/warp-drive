# @ember-data/adapter

:::warning ⚠️ Legacy Package
**Adapters are a LEGACY feature** that is no longer encouraged for new applications.

**For new projects:** Use {@link @warp-drive/core!RequestManager | Handlers} with the {@link @warp-drive/core!RequestManager | RequestManager} instead.
:::

This package provides REST and [{json:api}](https://jsonapi.org) Implementations of the legacy Adapter Interface when using the older packages.

**Why it's legacy:** The Adapter pattern was designed for class-based, inheritance-heavy architectures where each resource type could have its own data fetching logic. This approach:
- Creates tight coupling between your data layer and API implementation
- Makes it difficult to compose request logic or share behavior across resource types
- Lacks type safety and modern async patterns
- Requires runtime resolution and increases bundle size

**Modern alternative:** Use Handlers with the RequestManager. Handlers are composable, framework-agnostic functions that process requests through a pipeline. They support:
- Request builders for type-safe API calls
- Middleware-style composition (Gate, Fetch, CacheHandler)
- Better code splitting and tree shaking
- Framework-agnostic patterns that work in React, Vue, Svelte, and Ember

**When you still need this:** Only use Adapters if you're maintaining an existing Ember application that hasn't migrated to modern WarpDrive patterns.

For an alternative modern pattern to Adapters, see the [Request Handlers Guide](/guides/the-manual/requests/handlers).
